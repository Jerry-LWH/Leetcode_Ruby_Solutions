#Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

#String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

#Find the letter that was added in t.


# @param {String} s
# @param {String} t
# @return {Character}
def find_the_difference(s, t)
    s=s.split("")
    t=t.split("")
    s.each_with_index do |char,index| 
      t.delete_at(t.index(char))
    end
    t[0]
end
